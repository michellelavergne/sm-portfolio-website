## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass

I altered a template to fit the needs of the website. I had all the content for the site already so all I had to do was migrate it from another host that I had.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to migrate a domain from one server to another.
